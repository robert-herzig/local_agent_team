# AI Chat Application Setup Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Backend Running Successfully!

Your FastAPI backend is already running on http://localhost:8000 and working perfectly!

## 🎯 Next Steps - Choose Your Approach:

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended - No Node.js Required)

1. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Install and start Docker Desktop
   - Restart your computer if prompted

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # After Docker is installed, simply run:
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```
   
   Or double-click `start-app.bat` for an automatic setup!

### Option 2: Install Node.js (If you prefer local development)

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Download LTS version: https://nodejs.org/
   - Install with default settings
   - Restart your command prompt

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
